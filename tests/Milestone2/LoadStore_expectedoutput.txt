Instruction 1:
addi x1, x0, 100


x1 = x0 + 100 = 100

Memory unchanged

Registers:

x1 = 100
x2 = ?
x3 = ?

Instruction 2:
addi x2, x0, 25


x2 = x0 + 25 = 25

Memory unchanged

Registers:

x1 = 100
x2 = 25
x3 = ?

Instruction 3:
sw x2, 0(x1)


Store word x2 into memory at address x1 + 0 = 100

Memory[100] = 25

Registers unchanged

Registers:

x1 = 100
x2 = 25
x3 = ?


Memory:

Memory[100] = 25

Instruction 4:
lw x3, 0(x1)


Load word from memory at x1 + 0 = 100 into x3

x3 = Memory[100] = 25

Registers after load:

x1 = 100
